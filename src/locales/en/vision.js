    'The Vision2': 'Violas is a global platform that enables the issuance of reserve-backed stablecoins built on top of the Libra and Bitcoin blockchains. Violas enables third-party vendors to issue Libra compatible stablecoins that are pegged to their local fiat currency at a 1:1 ratio. Users will be able to send, receive, and secure their stablecoins just like the fiat currency in their bank account, only easier. Most importantly, unlike fiat banking, a userâ€™s stablecoins are protected by a cryptographic private key that only they have access to. Violas imagines a world of frictionless, secure payments, built for the modern world.'
