    'Violas White Paper':'Violas White Paper',
    'Violas White Paper1':'Violas\' mission is to build a global financial ecosystem that allows governments and organizations to create their own stablecoins backed by their local fiat currency. This ecosystem will exist on top of Libra technology, allowing it to reach billions of people for use in daily transactions as well as supporting exchange among all digital currencies.',
    'Violas White Paper2':'Our goal is to enable a world where there is not merely one global digital currency, but one where each fiat currency can have its own digital version pegged to it at a 1:1 ratio. We believe that the future will be a world of digitized fiat currencies and that blockchain technology and Libra’s codebase are the most efficient enablers to solve the many financial inadequacies the world faces in regards to payments and banking.',

    'Part 1.1':'1.1 The Burden of the Current Banking System',
    'Part 1.11':'The cost of opening and maintaining a bank account has rapidly increased due to expanding regulations and declining bank profit margins, in large part due to the rise in mobile applications that enable alternative payments systems to traditional banking. Consequently, the banking industry has aggressively shifted their cost of doing business to their customers as illustrated in the Libra White Paper.',
    'Part 1.2':'1.2 "Unbanked" People',
    'Part 1.21':'At the same time, there are still billions of people in developing countries that do not have access to their local banking system despite having access to mobile phones. This situation is similar to the landline phone system that was the standard before the invention of mobile phones. In these developing countries, many people skipped the landline phone system and went directly to mobile phones. This bypassing of legacy technology is set to happen again. This time, people in developing nations will skip the traditional banking system in favor of a blockchain based payment system using the mobile internet.',
    'Part 1.3':'1.3 The Blockchain and Digital Currency Solution',
    'Part 1.31':'As the mobile phone system becomes more widespread than the local banking system, mobile applications built on top of blockchain based payment systems will provide better and more efficient banking services than the traditional banking system. Mobile phone applications are already used for payments of everyday services such as transportation/ride-sharing, grocery delivery, micro loans, etc. In line with the convenience and efficiency of mobile payments, blockchain technology provides the necessary safety, security, transparency and real-time transaction speed to support and improve these everyday transactions.',

    'Part 2.0':'2. The Concerns and Challenges of Libra',
    'Part 2.01':'Libra is an important project with wide-ranging global potential. As a single global currency and financial, it is no doubt attracting criticism, concern, and challenge. This reaction is to be expected as the project aims to create a new global currency and financial infrastructure meant to disrupt the existing financial establishment.',
    'Part 2.1':'2.1 The Concerns of Libra',
    'Part 2.11':'The primary concern regarding the Libra project is the involvement of Facebook- the largest social media company in the world. Facebook’s reputation as a trusted entity has shifted over the years. Only recently, Facebook incurred a $5 billion fine for abusing their user data. Another concern regarding Libra is its backing by the US Dollar. This could enable the USD’s dominance to extend even further than the current system, especially when considering that the US government uses dollar-based banking systems to enforce US government sanctions against other countries. Of course, on the other side, the US government may be concerned that Libra will weaken the current dominance of the US dollar. This determination of Libra’s effect on the US dollar remains unknown for now.',
    'Part 2.2':'2.2 The Challenges to Libra',
    'Part 2.21':'As a single global currency and financial infrastructure, gaining approval from each local regulator, and satisfying local government regulations and laws, will be required. This may be a difficult and time consuming process. Libra will be backed through a basket of selected fiat currencies or securities. The currencies will be selected based on their stability. The countries whose local fiat currency are not included in the basket therefore cannot use Libra. This is seemingly antithetical to Libra\'s mission statement which aims to target developing countries; however, the currency in developing countries tends to be the most unstable. There is no easy solution to this contradiction. Another issue that will need resolution is how Libra will peg its price with the basket of selected fiat currencies as the weight of each currency can change daily.',
